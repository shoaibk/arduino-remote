# Relays the state of the LED control to the Arduino Board
#
# Setup:
# Run the board program (in board/arduino_led/arduino_led_d3)
# Make sure the remote server is running
# Install packages 'pySerial', and 'requests' if necessary, using either pip or easy_install
#
# Description:
# Communicates with the rails server using REST API.
# Sends an http GET to the rest endpoint. Checks the json response.
# If is_active is True, sends '1' to the board. LED should be switched ON after blinking.
# If is_active is False, sends '0' to the board. LED should be switched OFF after blinking.
#
# TODO: Graceful degradation when the remote server is offline
# TODO: Use push/websockets instead of polling server every few seconds
